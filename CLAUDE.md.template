## Project Overview
# Flutter Mobile Application

## Architecture
- **Clean Architecture** with Repository Pattern
- **Test-Driven Development** (TDD)
- **SQLite** for local data storage
- **Material Design 3** UI

## Development Commands

### Setup & Dependencies
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Running
```bash
flutter run                    # Run on connected device/emulator
flutter run -d chrome         # Run on web
flutter run -d windows/macos/linux  # Run on desktop
```

### Code Quality
```bash
flutter analyze               # Static analysis
flutter test                  # Run all tests
dart format .                 # Code formatting
```

### Building
```bash
flutter build apk           # Android APK
flutter build appbundle     # Android App Bundle  
flutter build ios           # iOS
flutter build web           # Web
flutter build windows/macos/linux  # Desktop
```

## Development Workflow

### Basic Flow
1. **Branch Creation**: `git checkout -b feature/feature-name`
2. **Development**: Follow TDD methodology (Red→Green→Refactor)
3. **Commit**: `git commit -m "description"`
4. **Push**: `git push origin branch-name`
5. **Pull Request**: Create PR for code review
6. **Review & Merge**: Code review and merge to main branch

### Quality Standards
- **TDD Required**: Red → Green → Refactor cycle
- **Test Coverage**: 80%+ coverage for new features
- **Code Formatting**: Run `dart format .` before commit
- **Static Analysis**: `flutter analyze` must pass
- **Architecture**: Follow Clean Architecture principles

### Branch Naming
| Prefix | Purpose | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `feature/` | New features | `feature/user-authentication` |
| `fix/` | Bug fixes | `fix/login-validation` |
| `docs/` | Documentation | `docs/api-documentation` |
| `refactor/` | Code refactoring | `refactor/database-layer` |
| `test/` | Test additions | `test/unit-tests` |

## Environment
- Flutter SDK 3.24.0+
