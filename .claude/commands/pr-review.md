### 3. Review Comment Templates

#### Severity Classification
- **ðŸ”´ Critical**: Must be fixed before production release
- **ðŸŸ¡ Major**: Recommended fix for quality improvement
- **ðŸ”µ Minor**: Improvement suggestion for future maintainability
- **ðŸ’¡ Suggestion**: Alternative approaches or best practice recommendations

#### Comment Examples

**Functionality-related Comments**
```
ðŸ”´ Critical: Inadequate Error Handling
File: src/utils/api.js:45
Issue: 
- Insufficient error handling for API request failures
- No appropriate error messages displayed to users

Suggested Fix:
Add try-catch blocks and display user-friendly error messages
```

**Test-related Comments**
```
ðŸŸ¡ Major: Insufficient Test Coverage
File: tests/components/UserForm.test.js
Issue:
- Missing test cases for validation error scenarios
- Only happy path is tested

Suggested Fix:
Add negative test cases to verify error state behavior
```

**Security-related Comments**
```
ðŸ”´ Critical: Input Validation Vulnerability
File: src/controllers/userController.js:23
Issue:
- User input is not sanitized
- Potential XSS attack vulnerability

Suggested Fix:
Use appropriate validation library to sanitize input values
```
